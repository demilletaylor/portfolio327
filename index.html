            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Visual Communication Design junior at San Francisco State
                University. This semester, I am planning to enroll in the SF State’s
                Scholars program to obtain my Master of Art in Visual Communication
                Design within a year of completing my Bachelor of Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in Oakland, CA, and raised in various parts of East Bay,
                mainly Hayward and San Leandro. During my high school years, I lived in
                the Central Valley, and missed the Bay Area greatly, so I returned to
                attend SFSU. Besides design, my greatest passion is music. I love
                discovering samples, collecting vinyls, Afrofuturism, and finding
                Africanisms in old and modern forms of Black American music. Beside
                being an avid music listener, I've played piano, violin, and cello at
                different points during my childhood. I'm is currently teaching myself
                how to play the bass guitar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since childhood, I have consistently utilized technology to create
                collages, vision boards, and edit videos. However, my true passion for
                graphic design emerged in high school. Now, as a college student with
                enhanced art and design knowledge, I can confidently say that graphic
                design is the perfect field for me. It serves as my outlet to visually
                showcase ideas, capturing the essence of events, people, or
                organizations accurately. My favorite aspect of design is branding,
                especially when building something from the ground up, handpicking
                typography, color, texture, and overall vibe. Conceptual designs, where
                I can create an entire brand based on a text prompt, are my favorite
                projects.

                        Using InDesign, I created a feature story/mini zine about the life and design style of
                        Emory Douglas, the former Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party.</figcaption>

                            For my made-up funk exhibit, I wanted to lean into the immersive aspect, so I took
                            inspiration from Parliament-Funkadelic's "Mothership Connection" album, incorporating
                            intergalactic elements and the exact typeface from the album. On my image-based poster, I
                            recreated Bootsy Collins' iconic "Space Bass" guitar.

                            For this branding project, I started my research process by exploring the most common
                            elements and ingredients in Arab and Levantine food. I also explored the meaning of
                            different
                            colors in Arab cultures and their significance. The through line that I identified was the
                            presence of green in various Arab and Islamic cultures as a symbol of peace, paradise, and
                            fertility of the land. With this in mind and the use of olives in various dishes, I chose to
                            also incorporate the olive branch motif. Mumtaz itself means" Distinguished, superior,
                            outstanding", so I wanted to give the overall identity a sleek and elegant feel.

                        <figcaption>I re-designed Beyoncé's "Renaissance" album cover to closely emulate the Italian
                            Renaissance. This is the first iteration and my favorite, because of the opulent style of
                            this
                            design.
